Python Seawater
===============

Introduction:
-------------

This python package contains a python translation for two MatlabTM Toolboxes.

(1) The `CSIRO seawater
toolbox <http://www.cmar.csiro.au/datacentre/ext_docs/seawater.htm>`_
(SEAWATER-3.3) for calculating the properties of sea water. The package uses the
formulas from Unesco's joint panel on oceanographic tables and standards, UNESCO
1981 and UNESCO 1983 (EOS-80) .

The EOS-80 library is considered now obsolete; it is provided here for
compatibility with old scripts, and to allow a smooth transition to the
new TEOS-10.

(2) The `Gibbs Sea Water <http://www.teos-10.org/software.htm>`_ (GSW v2.0).

A oceanographic toolbox of the International Thermodynamic Equation of
Seawater - 2010 or TEOS-10.

Contains the functions for evaluating the thermodynamic properties of pure water
(using IAPWS-09) and seawater (using IAPWS-08 for the saline part).
