The pyrhon-seawater package
===========================

Introduction
------------

The python-seawater package provides a python translation for the original 
CSIRO Matlab package. It contains basic functions for physical 
properties of sea water.

The author has no intention to do things in a "pythonic-way", it is just a 
"work around" from someone that couldn't afford Matlab anymore.

The the python-seawater package uses the formulas from Unesco's joint panel on 
oceanographic tables and standards, UNESCO 1981 and UNESCO 1983.

The present version is 1.0-3.2, released 27 January 2010. Although this version 
numbering seems odd, it means 1.0 for the python translation and 3.2 for the original 
Matlab version. That way one can keep track of the original version that python translation 
was based on.

User documentation
------------------

The functions are mainly polynomials, with an occasional fractional
exponent. The functions can therefore be used traditionally without NumPy to
compute a single value. With NumPy the functions act like "ufuncs" in the
NumPy sence. This means that they can take array arguments and return an
array of the same shape.
