Gibbs SeaWater oceanographic toolbox version 3 for python
---------------------------------------------------------

The official Gibbs SeaWater oceanographic toolbox for Matlab is
presently at version 3, see www.teos-10.org.

This directory contains the developing version 3 for python.  Note
that the update is not backwards compatible, as many functions has
changed names or functionality.
 
It is presently very incomplete and only useful for developing
purposes. For real use, use the (almost) complete version 2 in the
gibbs directory.

Both versions can be used together by careful imports::

  import seawater.gibbs as gsw    
  import seawater.gibbs3 as gsw3
